# Apply to be a Childminder Beta

A Django-based prototype for users to apply to be a childminder.

## Running the solution
To run the prototype you must first pull all Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then change the database host in settings.py to the BUILD server's IP address.

Once these dependencies have been gathered, you can run the prototype itself by issuing the command `python manage.py runserver`. After running this command, the prototype will be made available (using the default Django port) on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
